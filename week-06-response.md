<h1>The End of Green Screen?</h1>
<p> Murray's predictions were definitely accurate considering how far immersive virtual technology has improved since the 90s.
 Murray's predicition pretty much came to life with it manifesting in the set of "The Mandalorian" where they used LED screens
to project realstic environments into the set. Many of the comments on the video said they had no idea technology was used to film
 this movie and were wondering the actual locations of where they filmed their scenes. This set up is not only benefical for audiences
to enjoy a seamless experience, but for the actors to have more of a physical set to interact with, instead of having to imagine where
things may be as they'd have to do with green screen. Another bonus is it is more cost effective for production because they save on traveling
and other expenses.
