<h1>Project 2 Proposal</h1>
<p><br>A sick idea that I have for my project would be playing a video of a portal opening in the background while I'm doing something mundane like studying or listening to music.
<br>This would kind of be a play on that scene from Into the Spiderverse where Miles Morales is having a bad time controlling his spidey powers and his roommate barges in at the 
<br> worst time but is too distracted to even notice. If this is too complex to execute I can try something more subtle like a secret portal or invisibility cloak.
