For my project 3 I want to make a story where you have arrived at a new town and new school and befriend a classmate named James. 
James has a secret, though, having to do with the town's rumored existence of vampires. 
The more you hang out with James you see clues here and there that he is not a normal person, so it will be up to you to discover the truth about James all while keeping his trust as your friend.
