<h1>The Message is The Medium</h1>
<p  style="color:red;"><br>A fruitful example of a subject who's message changes depending on the medium would be food or more specifically, fruit.
<br> If I were to see a post if a strawberry out in the wild on the instagram I would assume the audience is being asked to see
<br> and appreciate the beauty of such a juicy shiny fruit. If I saw it out in the wild on an article I would I was being asked 
<br> to appreciate it as a healthy food or a possible addition to a tasty recipe. The three messages are the linguistic, 
the denoted, and connotated. 
<br> My examples more specifically compare a connotated message vs a linguistic one.
