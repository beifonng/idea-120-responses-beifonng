# **Hot Media** #
An example of hot media today would be platforms like YouTube or Netflix, which are pretty hot in both literal popularity and their formats of being purely consumed media. 
As support by Luhan, these platforms provide high definition material and the audience has to do nothing except sit back and relax while enjoying content.

# **Cold Media** #
An example of cold media today would be the phone/ talking over the phone. Simple phone conversations do not hold the same high definition as streaming platforms do and it is dependent on your response 
or interaction and participation to work. Facetiming/ video calling is a little warmer because you are provided much more context and information with the material of video but it is still reliant
on your participation to work.
