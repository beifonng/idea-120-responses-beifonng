# **Gesamtkunstwerk**


  The German word Gesamtkunstwerk directly translates to "the total work of art" and is the combination
of different art forms that come together to make an optimal immmersive experience. In context of 
contemporary tools, physical and digital media are perfects ways to portray the Gesamtkunstwerk.
Regarding digital media, virtual reality systems and games are a great reprensation of Gesamtkunstwerk
because of the creation of worlds using visual and auditory combined interactive elements. In VR art
installations or games, users are able to be completely immersed in these elements to the pointh where
it feels like a real addition to their reality. The power of the VR experience is being able to trigger
multitudes of the human sensories with physical elements from sound, audio, to more advanced systems
that can even use temperature.

Regarding physical tools, there are many traditional tools that would allow artists to create immersive
experiences one being the traditional arts of sculpting, painting, music, and performance. These are all
elements of fine arts that are capable of combining and becoming immersive experiences. A prominent example
used in Entangled by Chris Salter would be the art of theatre and performance productions where different
pioneers at the time improved its elements by finding ways to modernize the archeticture or lighting or
even the forms of performance being used. These all combine to make theatre performances seamless experiences
to audience members. Flight Paths from the Rhizome Anthology by Casey Reas is an example of Gesamtkunstwerk
because of its use of digital media, using animation, and auditory elements that create an immersive experience.
